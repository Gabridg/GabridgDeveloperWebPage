            <p class="description">Hi everyone! I'm Gabriele, a full stack web developer and UX designer I'm a passionate of videogaming from develope it to play it, also I'm a father of a beatiful boy. Enthusiast to learn new technologies or method to develope what i want or what i need.
                I began to become passionate about the world of technology through video games, especially FPS, and as time passed I began to ask myself more and more insistently how they could be developed; so I started developing my first very basic games, such as "minesweeper", "flappy birds" and "space invaders" obviously with some personal reinterpretations. 
                Understanding that I was passionate about this world, having obtained my scientific diploma, I began to take courses and obtain certifications to be able to learn everything I had and needed better and with a study criterion. I started with websites due to their lower complexity in development but due attention to detail and user detail, with responsiveness and scripts to improve the user experience. 
                I've currently been working as a full stack web developer for two and a half years but my secret dream is always to work for a large video game company, hoping one day to succeed.
